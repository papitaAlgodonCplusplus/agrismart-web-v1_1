## Test Programming Errors

### 1. Farm Validation Test - Disabled Button Click
**File:** `e2e/03-farms-crud.spec.ts:95`
**Test:** "should validate required fields in create form"
**Error Type:** ‚ùå TEST PROGRAMMING ERROR

**Issue:** The test attempts to click a disabled submit button to test validation, but Playwright cannot click disabled buttons. The test times out after 30 seconds waiting to click `<button disabled type="submit">`.

**Fix Needed:** Modify the test to check for validation messages or verify the button's disabled state instead of trying to click it.

```typescript
// Current (incorrect):
await submitButton.click(); // Fails on disabled button

// Should be:
await expect(submitButton).toBeDisabled();
// Or check for validation messages
```

---

### 2. Device Field Validation Test - Disabled Button Click
**File:** `e2e/05-devices-crud.spec.ts:113`
**Test:** "should validate required fields"
**Error Type:** ‚ùå TEST PROGRAMMING ERROR

**Issue:** Identical to Test #1. The test tries to click a disabled submit button and times out.

**Fix Needed:** Same as Test #1 - check button state or validation messages instead of clicking.

---

### 3. Device Refresh Test - Disabled Button Click
**File:** `e2e/05-devices-crud.spec.ts:176`
**Test:** "should refresh device data"
**Error Type:** ‚ùå TEST PROGRAMMING ERROR (or Application State Error)

**Issue:** The test attempts to click a refresh button that is disabled: `<button disabled class="btn btn-light">`.

**Fix Needed:** Either:
1. Wait for the button to become enabled before clicking
2. Investigate why the button is disabled (page loading state?)
3. Add proper wait conditions before attempting the click

```typescript
// Add proper wait:
await expect(refreshButton).toBeEnabled({ timeout: 10000 });
await refreshButton.click();
```

---

### 4. Browser Back Navigation Test
**File:** `e2e/06-other-pages.spec.ts:102`
**Test:** "should handle navigation with browser back button"
**Error Type:** ‚ùå POSSIBLY TEST PROGRAMMING ERROR

**Issue:** After navigating forward and going back, the test expects to be on `/farms` but is on `/crops` instead.

**Received:** `http://localhost:4200/crops`
**Expected:** URL containing "farms"

**Fix Needed:** Review the navigation sequence in the test to ensure it correctly tracks the history stack. Verify the test's understanding of which page should be reached after going back.

---

## Backend/Application Errors

### 5. Crop Creation Timeout
**File:** `e2e/04-crops-crud.spec.ts:59`
**Test:** "should create a new crop"
**Error Type:** üî¥ BACKEND/APPLICATION ERROR

**Issue:** Test timeout after 30 seconds. The crop creation operation never completes.

**Likely Cause:**
- Backend endpoint not responding
- Frontend not handling the response
- Database operation hanging

**Investigation Needed:** Check backend logs for the crop creation endpoint and verify database connectivity.

---

### 6. Devices Page - No Statistics Cards Rendered
**File:** `e2e/05-devices-crud.spec.ts:16`
**Test:** "should display devices list page"
**Error Type:** üî¥ APPLICATION ERROR

**Issue:** The page loads but no stat cards are rendered. Selectors `.stat-card`, `.stats-card`, and `.card` all fail to find any elements.

**Likely Cause:**
- Backend not returning device statistics data
- Component not rendering due to TypeScript error
- API call failing silently

**Investigation Needed:** Check the devices component TypeScript code and verify the backend API returns data.

---

### 7. Device Statistics Not Displayed
**File:** `e2e/05-devices-crud.spec.ts:22`
**Test:** "should display device statistics"
**Error Type:** üî¥ APPLICATION ERROR

**Issue:** Expected at least 1 statistics card but found 0.

**Likely Cause:** Same root cause as Test #6 - the devices page is not properly rendering statistics.

**Investigation Needed:** Check if backend endpoint `/api/devices/statistics` (or similar) is working and returning data.

---

### 8. Device Creation Fails Silently
**File:** `e2e/05-devices-crud.spec.ts:75`
**Test:** "should create a new device"
**Error Type:** üî¥ BACKEND/APPLICATION ERROR

**Issue:** After attempting to create a device, neither success message appears nor does the form close. The assertion `expect(hasSuccessMsg || isFormClosed).toBeTruthy()` fails.

**Likely Cause:**
- Backend endpoint failing to create device
- Frontend not handling response/error properly
- Validation failing on backend without proper error message

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check backend device creation endpoint
2. Review frontend error handling in device creation component
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

---

### 9. Production Units Page Not Loading
**File:** `e2e/06-other-pages.spec.ts:10`

**Issue:** After navigation, expected text "Unidades de Producci√≥n" or "Production" is not found on the page.

**Likely Cause:**
- Routing configuration issue
- Component not loading
- Backend data not being fetched

**Investigation Needed:** Check Angular routing for production units and verify the component loads.

---

### 10. Water Chemistry Page Not Loading
**File:** `e2e/06-other-pages.spec.ts:28`
**Test:** "should navigate to and display Water Chemistry page"
**Error Type:** üî¥ APPLICATION/ROUTING ERROR

**Likely Cause:** Same as Test #9 - routing or component loading issue.

---

### 11. Fertilizers Page Not Loading
**File:** `e2e/06-other-pages.spec.ts:38`
**Test:** "should navigate to and display Fertilizers page"
**Error Type:** üî¥ APPLICATION/ROUTING ERROR

**Issue:** Text "Fertilizantes" not found on the page after navigation.

**Likely Cause:** Routing or component issue.

---

### 12. Login/Authentication Failure During Test Setup
**File:** `e2e/06-other-pages.spec.ts:45` (beforeEach hook)
**Test:** "should navigate to and display Fertilizer Inputs page"
**Error Type:** üî¥ BACKEND/AUTHENTICATION ERROR

**Issue:** The test failed during the `beforeEach` hook when trying to log in. The login never redirected to the dashboard, timing out after 30 seconds.

**Likely Cause:**
- Backend authentication service down or unresponsive
- Database connection lost
- Session management issue
- Previous tests left the system in a bad state

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check if backend was still running at this point in test execution
2. Review authentication endpoint logs
3. Check database connectivity
4. Consider adding test isolation/cleanup between test suites

---

**Error Type:** üî¥ APPLICATION/AUTHENTICATION ERROR

**Issue:** After clicking logout, user remains on the dashboard page instead of being redirected to the login page.

**Expected:** Redirect to `/login`
**Received:** Still on `http://localhost:4200/dashboard`

**Likely Cause:**
- Logout endpoint not properly clearing session
- Auth guard not redirecting unauthenticated users
- Frontend not handling logout response correctly
- Token/session not being cleared from localStorage/sessionStorage

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check logout endpoint implementation
2. Verify auth guard configuration

## Notes

- The pattern of multiple pages failing (Tests #9-15) suggests a systematic issue rather than individual page problems
- Authentication failures (Tests #12, #16) may have cascading effects on other tests
- Test #11 failed during setup, which could indicate the backend became unresponsive partway through the test suite
- Consider running tests in isolation to determine if there are inter-test dependencies or state issues
