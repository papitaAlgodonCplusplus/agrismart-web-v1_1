localhost:4200 nutrient-formulation has soil analysis included for simple formulations, but not for advanced formulations this is because we have yet not implemented it in 1. Python calculator "
@app.get("/swagger-integrated-calculation")
async def swagger_integrated_calculation_with_linear_programming(..."

1. Include it in python first, search in C# backend SoilAnalysis info about the SoilAnalysis
GET
​/CropProduction​/{cropProductionId}​/SoilAnalysis endpoint to understand how info comes

2. Then update the angular component advanced tab to allow optionally the user to select a soil to inlcude in the calculus

3. Use ChromeDevTools to test the integration works with my running localhost:4200,
if u need to restart python, backend or frontend tell me to do it and wait for my confirmation before continuing testing.
